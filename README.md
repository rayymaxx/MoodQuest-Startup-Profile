🌈 MoodQuest

MoodQuest is a gamified mental wellness platform designed to help teens and tweens build emotional resilience through storytelling, quests, and playful self-care tools.


💡 About the Project

MoodQuest was born from a simple but urgent truth: today’s teens are struggling, and traditional mental health support isn’t reaching them. Our co-founder, a school psychologist with over a decade of experience, saw countless students battling anxiety, self-doubt, and stress in silence.

After one student said, *"I wish therapy was more like a game"*, the spark for MoodQuest was lit.


🎯 Mission  
Empower young people to take charge of their emotional wellness — through quests, reflection, and play.
